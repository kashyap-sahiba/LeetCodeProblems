In the realm of algorithms, where logic takes its flight,
A symphony of data structures, dancing in the light.
A poem on DSA, let the verses unfold,
As we traverse the landscapes of algorithms untold.

In arrays and matrices, elements arrayed,
A symphony of order, in their structure laid.
Linear tales they tell, in an ordered parade,
Through indices and loops, a journey well played.

Linked lists, like verses, in a chain so divine,
Nodes interwoven, in a captivating line.
Traversal through pointers, like stanzas entwine,
A tale of connections, in each nodal sign.

Trees, a metaphor for growth, branching wide,
Rooted in the depths, with leaves as a guide.
Traversal through branches, on paths we bide,
In the forest of algorithms, where trees abide.

Graphs, a network of tales, vertices and edges,
Connections interlace, in storytelling pledges.
Traversing paths, across algorithmic ledges,
A narrative woven, as the algorithm alleges.

Queues and stacks, in their orderly queue,
A poetic rhythm, in their push and pop cue.
LIFO and FIFO, like poetic values true,
In algorithmic verses, they come into view.

Searching algorithms, seeking a poetic rhyme,
Binary or linear, marking the passage of time.
A quest for patterns, in rhythm and chime,
In the algorithmic verses, a cadence to prime.

Sorting arrays, like arranging verses in grace,
Merge, quicksort, in an ordered embrace.
Shuffling elements, like poetic space,
In the DSA symphony, each note finds its place.

Dynamic programming, a stanza refined,
Subproblems solved, in a recursive bind.
Memoization's ink, in solutions designed,
In the poetry of algorithms, brilliance defined.

In the tapestry of DSA, a poetic art,
Algorithmic verses, a masterpiece to impart.
A sonnet of logic, where patterns chart,
In the realms of data, where poems start.

So, let the algorithms weave, in a rhythmic spree,
A poem on DSA, in its complexity.
In the algorithms' embrace, where solutions decree,
A poetic journey through data's vast sea.
